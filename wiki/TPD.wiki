#summary Test Plan Document for Mobile Musician

= Test Plan Document =

== 8.1 Introduction ==

This document outlines the plans for how Mobile Musician will be tested.  It includes unit testing, integration testing, and acceptance testing.  Some tests will be run through manual procedures but some will be automated through assert statements in test files.  There will be one main test file that will run all the individual automated tests.

== 8.5 Test Configuration Control ==

A majority of the testing is done graphically, so configuration control is unnecessary for those.  However, some tests are made in test files using assertions.  These tests will be committed along with the project in a directory called test.
