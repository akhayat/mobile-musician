 * SoundBankPlayer is a sample-based audio player that uses OpenAL. It employs
 * "sound banks", which contain a set of samples. Each sample covers one or 
 * more notes, which allows you to implement a full instrument with only a few 
 * samples (like SoundFonts but simpler).
 *
 * The SoundBankPlayer takes care of setting up the Audio Session. You only
 * have to provide the sound samples (in CAF format) and a PLIST file that 
 * describes how the samples map to MIDI notes.
 *
 * The sound samples must always be mono. SoundBankPlayer pans the notes to 
 * achieve a stereo effect.
