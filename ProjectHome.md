## Why Mobile Musician? ##

Mobile Musician is an iPod Touch or iPhone App targeted toward musicians that either need an easy way to create new melodies or record a melody that they are unable to write down.  (It's also a good App for people that just enjoy making noise and pressing buttons.)

## What is it? ##

The main view in Mobile Musician consists of a grid of squares that, when touched, play a note. The notes in the grid are arranged so that, starting in the top left corner and moving to the right then down then left again (and so on in this fashion), an entire musical scale is played.  By default, the scale is chromatic (that is, it contains all notes), but the root and type of scale (either a predefined one or custom) is editable by the user through the menu.  The user can also change the instrument from a piano (the default) to a clean or a distorted guitar.
